                    <p> Hello, my name is Justin. I am a programmer by trade and love to solve problems. I can't even enjoy playing a video game or using compelling software without my mind ruining it by ripping it apart trying to figure out how it works.</p>
                    <p> I've always enjoyed taking things apart and staring at the insides wondering what every piece does. This resulted in many talks to explain why (insert expensive thing parents bought me) either broke or went missing when I couldn't put it back together again... Since I wasn't good at reassembling things, I moved on to learning how software works since I could safely dissect it to learn how the programming works.</p>
                    <p> That led me to earn my bachelor's degree in Video Game & Simulation Programming from DeVry University. The constant innovation in software and programming satiates my desire to continually learn what makes things tick.</p>
